CatClicker2

A while ago, I made a simple clicker/idle game in Java Swing called "CatClicker", and have recreated it in JavaFX here.

In this game, you have an amount of points, which can be increased by clicking on the button on which the points are displayed. The rate at which points are added can be increased by purchasing rate upgrades with points, increasing in potency and price the further into the game you are. The goal of the game is to aquire 1 Quadrillion points.
There is also a switch called "Idle Mode", which disables the button and increases the points by the set rate automatically every second. This process will continue when the window is minimized.
In the "File" menu, there are options to save a game to a text file and load that game later. Loading text files not created by CatClicker2 may be rejected or crash the game.
